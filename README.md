# Description :
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. The Random Forest classifier provided the best results. The notebook also visualizes word distributions using word clouds and histograms.

# Tools and Technologies :
**Programming Language**: Python üêç

**Libraries & Frameworks**:
Data Processing & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
